"""
This script converts images into usable data in csv format.

NOTE: Although converting images to CSV is not necessary, it is useful
to know how to implement reconstruction and recognition when data is
originally given in CSV format with no image reference. Images are expected
to be 300x300 pixels.

Information found to extract data from images:
- https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/images.html
Added loop for multiple images.
