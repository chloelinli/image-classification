# image classification project
practicing with machine learning and image recognition

check out the blog [here](https://chloerushing.wixsite.com/da-portfolio/image-recognition-series)!

### overview
this project was originally a previous MATLAB assignment that asked how accurately we can reconstruct and recognize images. i converted the code to python with the goal of analyzing the accuracy and efficiency of image recognition utilizing several machine learning algorithms.

### data
the data is a bunch of pictures off of google images :) hoping to try web scraping in the future!

**Skills**: Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib.pyploy), Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets
