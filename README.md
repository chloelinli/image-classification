### [Image Reconstruction and Recognition](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/art_facial_recognition)
I took a past assignment that asked to see how accurately we can reconstruct and recognize images, and converted the language used from MATLAB to Python. I also expanded on recognition by including three difficulties for testing image comparison. To further expand on the project, I plan to calculate runtime as well as look into varying methods of reconstruction and recognition to find which are the most efficient and accurate.
- [x] Conversion
- [x] Reconstruction with SVDs
- [x] Recognition with SVDs
- [x] Recognition with XGBoost
- [ ] Additional recognition methods

**Skills**: Python, Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets
